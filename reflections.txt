Your response goes here!

I learned about some new tags and adding some attributes to them.

The general layout of the tree is pretty easy.

Something that is difficult is remembering the exact way a tag functions.

I've used some of my problem solving strategies from the previous project to help overcome challenges by keep iterating, taking a break now and again, and looking things up if I don't remember how to use something.
